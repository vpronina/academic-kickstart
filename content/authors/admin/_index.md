I am currently a Ph.D. student at Skoltech under the supervision of Prof. [Dmitry Dylov](https://faculty.skoltech.ru/people/dmitrydylov). At the moment I am working on learnable algorithms for image restoration.

The scope of my research interests includes deep learning, machine learning, computer vision, inverse problems in imaging and signal processing, especially in biomedical field. I received my first Master degree from Bauman Moscow State Technical University in Moscow, Russia. During that time I was working on the development of algorithms and system for the effective processing of biomedical signals such as respiratory waves, electrocardiogram and electromyogram. After that I continued my studies and graduated with my second Master degree from École des Mines in Saint-Étienne, France, where I was working on application of machine learning for characterization of microscopic tissue images.

Apart of doing research, I play flute in the Neapolitan Ensemble named after Misailov.

For more information, please see my [CV](files/cv.pdf) or contact me via [mail](mailto:valeriya.pronina@skoltech.ru).
